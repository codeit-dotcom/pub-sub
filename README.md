# In-Memory Pub/Sub System (Java + Spring Boot + WebSockets)

This is a simplified Pub/Sub system implemented in Java using Spring Boot.  
It provides:

- WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) for publishing, subscribing, unsubscribing, and ping.
- REST APIs for topic management (create, delete, list), health checks, and stats.
- Multi-publisher and multi-subscriber support.
- In-memory state only (no database or external broker).
